            The top guy in charge of making sure the team's people and staff is taken care of is going to be Dustin Peek.
            He has a background in competitive gaming through being sponsored himself by UT Knoxville during his time in
            college and actively finds more ways to play games competitively to this day. To speak a little bit on his
            background for each community, let's take a look at what he's done:<br><br>

            Fighting Games: Dustin has been a part of the FGC for over 10 years now, starting his career and sponsorship when
            he played Super Smash Bros. From Smash, he moved on to play more traditional fighting games in the form of DragonBall FighterZ,
            Tekken 7, and BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle. He's earned a few medals and multiple top 3 placements at larger tournaments,
            but unfortunately could never break into that first place spot, even when things seemed to be stacked in his favor.<br><br>

            Shooters: While this is his weakest genre of the three, he's played shooters for as long as he can remember, 
            starting with Halo when he was a kid. As he's gotten older, he played Overwatch to a some time with a group
            who wanted to climb the ranked ladder, but ultimately that team fell apart and he just kept his few connections
            in case he ever wanted to keep up with the going ons in the shooter community since said connections play
            a wide variety of shooters.<br><br>

            MOBA's: This background is a bit more cursed. Man played League of Legends back in highschool and continued to do
            so until the Fight Game Community caught his interest. Nowadays, he competitively plays a MOBA called Eternal Return.
            He's entered tournaments on multiple occasions, whether officially or community ran, but has never broken into podium
            placements. However, similar to his shooter experience, he knows people in said community so that he can always stay informed
            about when and where events are taking place.<br><br>
